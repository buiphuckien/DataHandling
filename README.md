This project shows how to use Pandas and Numpy to manipulate data frame. Here I illustrate the common task in working with data. The project contains eight jupyter notebook files.

    applyFunctionDataFrame.ipynb shows how to apply a function to columns of a dataframe.

    concateDataFrame.ipynb exhibits the way to concate two dataframes - by row and by column.

    createDataFrame.ipynb displays how to create a dataframe, add columns, and add rows to a dataframe.

    groupByDataFrame.ipynb covers how to find max, min, average, etc on groups.

    handleNaNDataFrame.ipynb indicates how to replace NaN (not a number) with a number.

    mergeDataFrame.ipynb illustrates how to merge two data frame. There are similarities in merging two dataframes and joining two tables of relational database.

    WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv is the file that was used to load data in the mentioned files.

Handling data is a routine task for data scientists. This porject covers the common methods they normaly use.
